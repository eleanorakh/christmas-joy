## Sides

- [Chickpea Salad with Red Onion, Sumac, and Lemon;][chickpea-recipe]
- Fresh salad;
- Cauliflower and Tahini Salad

These are to go with Dads amazing Turkey and couscous. And spuds of course!
Aside from chopping, the only thing that really needs to be done for these
is roasting the cauliflowers, chickpeas, and nuts. Which can all be done the day before.

**Chickpea Salad with Red Onion, Sumac, and Lemon**

- 3 cups uncooked chickpeas (or four tins)
- 4 garlic cloves, smashed
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 large red onion, sliced very thin
- 1 tablespoon sumac
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 bunch Italian parsley, leaves finely chopped
- 1 large lemon, juiced (about 3 tablespoons)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons pomegranate syrup **Note: I can get this really easy**
- 5 to 6 sprigs fresh mint

1. Cover the chickpeas with water in a large bowl and soak overnight. Or do a fast soak: Cover with an inch of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, cover, and soak for 1 hour.
2. Drain in the soaked chickpeas. Cover with fresh water and stir in the garlic cloves and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then lower the heat and simmer for 60 minutes to 2 hours, or until just tender but not falling apart. You can also cook them in the pressure cooker for about 40 minutes (or according to your pressure cooker instructions). When cooked, spread on a large baking sheet to cool.
3. Recipe Shortcut: You can also substitute 4 cans of canned chickpeas. Drain and rinse thoroughly before using. I do encourage you to use freshly cooked chickpeas; they are creamy and tender in a really different way than canned garbanzos.
4. While the chickpeas are cooling, peel and quarter the onion. Shave it as thin as possible into a large bowl, using a very sharp knife or a mandoline. Stir in the sumac, chili powder, and salt. Use your hands to massage the spices and salt into the onions for several minutes. Drain off any liquid that develops in the bottom of the bowl.
5. Add the chickpeas and chopped parsley to the onions and use your hands or two forks to toss everything thoroughly.
6. Whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, and pomegranate syrup and toss with the salad. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Continue tossing until the onions are fully incorporated and no longer in small clumps. Refrigerate until serving (this salad gets better overnight).
7. Just before serving, finely chop the mint leaves and sprinkle over the salad
